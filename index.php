<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The Heart of Texas Silhouette Association, also known as HOTSA, is a private, members only, rifle range and gun club located a little over an hour drive from either the Dallas/Ft. Worth area or Waco in the heart of Central Texas.</p>
<p>HOTSA is dedicated to the sport of silhouette; BPCR, High Power, 22, and Varmint shooting sports. Our range features berms from 25 to 750 yards that accommodate pistol shooting to long range rifle shooting.

Our members have full access to the range year round regardless of match schedules with live fire allowed during daylight hours only; <strong>no night shooting allowed</strong>.</p>
<p>HOTSA holds NRA sanctioned BPCR silhouette matches the first Saturday of each month, and 22 BPCRA matches the third Saturday of each month. These matches are weather permitting and are usually a 40 shot format. In the fall, registration begins about 8:00am with the match commencing at 9:00am.  In the summer, the match will begin about 8:30am.
