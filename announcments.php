Important Announcement VBRS March 25, 2017!
<br>
<br>
Dear Fellow VBRS Shooters!
<br>
<br>
I hope all have been preparing &amp; awaiting for our 1st VBRS Match of the year!  We are currently scheduled to hold our 1st match on Saturday March 25, 2017 (4th Saturdays March-October).  FYI, I was recently made aware that the Shooting USA show can be seen on their website, order a DVD from them (<a href="http://www.shootingusastore.com/items/show-dvds/2016-17-season-shooting-usa-shows/36-02-texas-varmint-bench-rest-detail.htm">http://www.shootingusastore.com/items/show-dvds/2016-17-season-shooting-usa-shows/36-02-texas-varmint-bench-rest-detail.htm</a> ) or after 3 months on the Outdoor Channel  ( <a href="http://www.outdoorchannel.com/show.aspx?show-id=985&articletype=&key=Shooting-USA">http://www.outdoorchannel.com/show.aspx?show-id=985&articletype=&key=Shooting-USA</a> ) or the Shooting Usa YouTube ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWyI8FMj-_N8l1W2WMF-ABi9CzItc7g9u">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWyI8FMj-_N8l1W2WMF-ABi9CzItc7g9u</a> ).  I was extremely satisfied with how well the show turned out &amp; how well they told the "stories" also.  An extremely professional group of folks to work with.  Hopefully we can bring them back someday for a "Rematch".
<br>
<br>
I would also like to mention that it might be necessary to request "Reservation(s)" if the attendance is going to be @ or near our 36 Shooters (3 Relays of 12 Shooters) limit.  I have received inquiries &amp; feedback from quite a few folks that have expressed an interest in our new match.  I don't want someone to make a trip &amp; incur the cost/time &amp; not be able to shoot because we were "full".  I would like to discuss this matter @ our Shooters Meeting &amp; have a vote on doing a Reservation thing maybe.  I could easily list the "# of Reservations" on the HOTSA Calendar that can be maintained "real time" so anybody could inquire &amp; determine if they wanted to make a Reservation &amp; come &amp; shoot.  Please give this some thought.  A reservation could be made by email or Text to me &amp; I'll reflect the # received &amp; update it on the calendar.  Thanks in advance for your time in discussing this item.
<br>
<br>
On a really neat item, the club has decided to add 2 more Chickens (600) &amp; Pigs (750) which will enable us to shoot 12 @ a time (6 critters ea).  This will help expedite the match &amp; I don't anticipate much/any delay starting the long line after we finish the 1st 4 Critters.  This is a large expense for us, but our hopes is that it will help us in running a more efficient match.
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing your Folks again! 
<br>
<br>
David Brady

Varmint Benchrest Silhouette (VBRS) 2017 Info &amp; Schedule
<br>
<br>
Dear Fellow Varmint Benchrest Silhouette Shooters!
<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to this years activities &amp; hopefully it will continue to be received well by our shooting family. The HOTSA club &amp; I do appreciate your support of our VBRS matches &amp; are looking forward to another season in 2017.  I hope you will slot the 4th Saturday to come &amp; shoot with us as-often-as possible. In regards to the Shooting USA segment, my last update from Shooting USA was that it is still on track to air sometime in February.  Elise did confirm that we will have access to a copy that we can download or whatever to watch.  I personally am looking forward to seeing it myself.  They said that their website has a listing of scheduled Segments listed, this is the best way to pin point the exact "air date" is @ the TV Schedule link @  <a href="http://www.shootingusa.com" title="Shooting USA">http://www.shootingusa.com</a>.  Please let you friends &amp; family know all about it, &amp; encourage them to come out &amp; participate.
<br>
<br>
Just thought I would send some notes about 2017 schedules, things &amp; information:
<br>
<br>
Please be advised that the Range &amp; Club has a New Owner!  The HOTSA club is intact exactly as it has been &amp; all functions will be operating as scheduled.  The only change is that we require the Shooters to sign a "Liability Waiver" before the can commence shooting.  We will have the Form @ the Stat Office &amp; it will be available when you Register.  It's a standard type Form that many organizations use currently.
<br>
<br>
We will continue slotting the 4th Saturday of each month March thru October to hold our VBRS Match(s) with the Shooters meeting @ 8:30 &amp; match -s- @ 9:00.  I will hold August as "Tentative" due to the normal Heat problem.
<br>
<br>
Set-up routine will be the same: show up pick your spot, get your group together &amp; sign in.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully we will not require Advance Entry unless the participation becomes @/near max as we can only realistically shoot 3 Relays (36 Shooters).  If that becomes so, we could easily ask for "Reservations" to help the Shooters plan ahead so to not waste a trip if we are "Full".  
<br>
<br>
Currently @ this time we cannot effectively have more than 3 Relays or 36 Shooters.  It would make it very difficult to finish @ a reasonable hour even being as efficient as we can.
<br>
<br>
HOTSA is reviewing the feasibility of adding 2 more Targets @ the 600 &amp; 750, which would enable us to shoot 12 @ a time like we are currently doing @ the other 4 Critters.
<br>
<br>
We do have a "Calendar" on our website now. It has the scheduled events &amp; it will also be used for last minute things if necessary (weather etc).  Please visit the website often to keep up with the latest info etc @ http://www.hotsa.org/ @ the Calendar Link.
<br>
<br>
This particular VBRS Match is very expensive to host as it requires 4 Target Sitters &amp; 2 ATV's to expedite time between Relays &amp; all the set-up &amp; put up tasks.  I am going to have to reduce the "Payout" to 20% (Net) so that the club can afford a more reasonable compensation to the Target Sitters.  I hope that you understand and we will continue to have the "Tip Jar" available for the Shooters to additionally put some money in their pockets for exceptional service.  Tips are required to supplement this part of the match.
<br>
<br>
Once again, thank you for your support &amp; interest &amp; we look forward to this years matches &amp; seeing old &amp; new Friends.  Please encourage others to come out &amp; observe &amp; try this new sport with us.
<br>
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
<br>
David Brady

<p>
VBRS/Shooting USA
<br>
<br>
I am pleased to announce that the club hosted the "Shooting USA" Team @ our 10/22/2016 VBRS Match.  The "Shooting USA" Team came down from Tennessee to shoot our match as a segment to their show on the Outdoor Channel.  I feel that it was beyond successful &amp; personally rewarding to participate in such an event.  The Shooting USA team recorded almost continuously during the match which lasted from around 9:00 till 4:00; the crew all conveyed to me that it "was a good shoot &amp; we have something unique going on here &amp; lots of neat stories".  John Scoutten was participating as a Competitor in shooting the match right along beside us.  I didn't think far enough ahead (it's hard to find good help nowadays) to have our own photographer present to document the event, but we will be able to a have a "link" on our website when it is completed.  If anyone took some pics, please send them to me so we can get them in our Gallery section.
<br>
<br>
Attached are the results of our VBRS/Shooting USA match:
<br>
<br>
1st Place = Monte Sutton 53 (reverse animal count=Silhouette methodology to minimize shoot-offs).
<br>
2nd Place = Donnel Gaines 53
<br>
3rd Place = Denny Henderson 52 (reverse animal count also) 
<br>
Bunches of real good scores, "10-in-a-rows" while shooting @ "Little Bitty Critters" @ long distances.
<br>
A 16 yr old young man by the name of Will Toronjo shot a score = 51 which is up there with the "Big Dogs".  What ya bet that Dad's proud of that accomplishment!
<br>
It's real difficult to judge wind &amp; mirage @ these distances, there ain't no "Gimmies" @ this game &amp; the Targets really need to be bigger.
<br>
Several New Shooters, Old Shooters, &amp; Young Shooters.
<br>
Several Father/Son teams with one team of a Father &amp; 2 Sons.
<br>
Handicapped/Disabled Shooters &amp; Veterans can also compete @ this sport.
<br>
Target Sitters don't make enough money for their Time &amp; Effort.
<br>
Lots &amp; lots of Happy Noises, Smiling Faces, &amp; Friends having fun.
<br>
Shooting USA incurring the time, trouble &amp; expense to "record the event" for us.
<br>
Whoever ordered the weather should get a raise.
<br>
<br>
Sorry to be "Gooey", but I personally think it was a neat day &amp; I got to meet several new friends &amp; a whole bunch of Folks were newly inducted into the "Shootin @ Shit" group.  The HOTSA club looks forward to doing this again next year.  Please ck our website @ http://www.hotsa.org/ to keep up with our events, announcements &amp; schedules.  We also shoot High Power Metallic Silhouettes (centerfire &amp; .22 rimfire), Lever action Silhouettes, BPCS &amp; 22 BPCS (Black Powder Cartridge Silhouettes centerfire &amp; .22 rimfire), VBRS @ our club.  Sorry the match takes so long, but there's a lot going on &amp; it consumes a lot of time &amp; effort to shoot @ 6 "Critters" all the way out to 750 yds.  I apologize for my errors in calling the Match &amp; appreciate your understanding &amp; flexibility especially @ the 600 &amp; 750 yd Targets.  The club will try &amp; learn from this &amp; make improvements where we can.  Shooting USA will advise when their routine is complete &amp; when the anticipated broadcast will be.  They did advise me that a good source for schedule info will be available @ their website: <a href="http://www.shootingusa.com/" title="Shooting USA">http://www.shootingusa.com/</a>; roughly maybe in the February 2017 time-frame.

VBRS Pre Registration 10/22/16 Shoot
<br>
<br>
In an effort to get this out as-early-as-possible I am attaching a Pre-Registration Form for you to fill out &amp; get back to us to slot your spot for the "VBRS/Shooting USA" segment @ the HOTSA Range on 10/22/2016 (4<sup>th</sup> Saturday). I think that we keep the match @ 36 shooters maximum so that adequate time is provisioned to complete both tasks of shooting a VBRS match &amp; allowing the "Shooting USA" staff to get what they need done also. 
<br>
<br>
If you're interested, please remit the Form &amp; payment so we will know exactly how many folks are coming. I have re-confirmed with Jim Scoutten that the match is "on the schedule" &amp; barring any unforeseen circumstances will occur as scheduled. Once again, I appreciate your support in this matter &amp; appreciate your joint interest in showing a new version of "Shootin @ Shit" that appeals to many disciplines of the shooting sports. We will not be pre-assigning Bank Assignments on Pre-Registration Entries @ this time. I am also attaching a revised copy of the HOTSA VBRS Competitor Information sheet along with the pre-registration form for your information.
<br>
<br>
Please mark you calendars for our September VBRS Match 09/24/2016 (4<sup>th</sup> Saturday) &amp; come &amp; shoot with us as it will be the last opportunity before our "Shooting USA" match. So far I haven't seen enough interest to shoot a match in August; if we could get 15-20 shooters committed; I think we could slot the 08/27/16 (4<sup>th</sup> Saturday). Typically, the August heat is oppressive &amp; real hard on barrels &amp; sustained accuracy if unable to get the barrel cooled down will cause misses that you can't control. Anyway, it's real hot &amp; we need to make sure that none of us "Old Farts" aren't "belly up" out there. I know for a fact that that would piss my wife off, not because she'd miss me, but that the Medical costs would be excessive &amp; unnecessary.

These were some pretty impressive scores and I was very proud of all the guys coming to give a shot at the latest shooting sport around engaging targets from 200 meters to 750 yards!

Annual Membership Meeting
<br>
<br>
On January 30, 2016, we held our annual membership meeting at the HOTSA range. New officers and directors were elected and we discussed new business. Quite a few members showed up and we had a good and productive meeting. HOTSA.org is our new website. Information regarding the club, the upcoming matches, the dates of the matches, and general information will be available soon.</p>
<p>Our Benchrest style matches such as the 400 yd. Clay Shoot and the Varmint Silhouette Match will both be held on the 4th Saturday of a month. The first Varmint Silhouette Match will be Saturday, April 23rd, 2016 and the first 400 yd. Clay Shoot will be Saturday, June 25th, 2016. We are not planning matches during July and August, due to the hot weather. Other match dates will be in September and October.  The schedule will be on the website and we will send out emails prior to the matches.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, we are not going to move the range to another site.  We have arranged to continue leasing the property where the range has been for many years.</p>
<p>We had a bulldozer on the range February 1st, working on repairing roads and adding some berms, including a new berm as close to 800 yd. as possible.</p>
<p>At this time, we are planning an Open Range “Practice Day” on Saturday, March 26th. We will set up clay targets and Varmint Silhouette targets from 200 – 500 meters just for fun shooting. Also, shooters are welcome to bring your own targets and shoot at whatever distance you would like. Donations are welcome but there will be <strong>NO CHARGE</strong> for using the range that day. Come to HOTSA and get some practice three weeks before the 400 Yd. Texas Benchrest Clay Match at Utopia, TX. Or just for your fun and shooting practice. Remember to bring your own bench, if you have one. We only have a few benches and they are not very steady.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you and appreciate your support of the HOTSA range.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Denny Henderson</p>
