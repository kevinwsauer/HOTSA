<h2>2015 Match Schedule</h2>
<p>The general schedule is as follows but check with the match directors before making the trip if you are not sure.  I keep up with the BPCR discipline, but I'm not in the loop on the other shoots held at HOTSA, so I can't be sure of all the schedules.  We don't publish the phone numbers here, so you may need to email us first so you can find the match director's contact information.  Sorry for this inconvenience, but it's a necessary evil in the world of phishing.</p>
<p>1st Sat or month: BPCR, big bore match<br>
Match Director Ken Tebbe</p>
<p>2nd Sunday: High Power Silhouette and 22 silhouette<br>
Match Director Jack Garrette and Dave Wester</p>
<p>3rd Saturday: Rimfire BPCR<br>
Match Director Ken Tebbe</p>
<p>4th Saturday 9:00: VBR (varmint bench rest) but don't drive out unless you've received a confirmation email or call.  This emerging game is still being developed and the schedule should line out in a few months and be more consistent.<br> 
Match directors: Ken Tebbe</p> 
<p>4th Sunday: Lever Action Silhouette<br>
Match Director: Rick Merritt</p>
